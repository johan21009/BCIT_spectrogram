# EEG-Based Classification of Driving Performance through Spectrogram Analysis
Maintaining optimal driving performance is critical for road safety, as it depends
on various cognitive factors, including attention, reaction time, and decisionmaking.
Cognitive load and attentional shifts influence driving behavior, and
EEG-based analysis offers a promising method to assess these cognitive states
in real-time. While previous research has explored EEG for attention detection,
its direct correlation with driving performance remains underdeveloped.
Driving performance is influenced by multiple factors, including environmental
conditions, driver fatigue, and cognitive workload. Traditional methods for
assessing driver performance, such as behavioral observation and self-reports,
are often subjective and lack real-time precision. By utilizing EEG, it is possible
to gain insights into neural activity that correlates with cognitive states
affecting driving efficiency. The analysis of EEG data provides a time-frequency
representation that allows for a more detailed investigation of transient neural
patterns associated with driving behaviors.
Additionally, modern driving assistance systems rely heavily on external sensors,
such as cameras and radar, to monitor driver behavior. However, these
systems do not account for internal cognitive states that may impact reaction
time and decision-making. By integrating EEG-based classification models into
these systems, it is possible to develop more comprehensive driver monitoring
technologies that enhance road safety and mitigate accident risks.
This project aims to classify driving performance using spectrograms images extracted from EEG data using machine
learning techniques. By analyzing the spectrograms and associated behavioral
responses in a driving simulator environment, we seek to develop a robust classification
model to differentiate between high and low driving performance states.
The outcomes of this study will contribute to cognitive neuroscience and intelligent
transport systems by enabling real-time driver state monitoring, ultimately
improving driver safety, reducing accidents, and advancing adaptive driver assistance
technologies.
